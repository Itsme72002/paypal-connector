Integration testing with Paypal's API of the implemented methods can be found
in org.mule.module.paypal.integration.PaypalTestDriver.

============================================
  Creating developer and sandbox accounts
============================================

This tests require existing merchant and buyer's sandbox accounts. In order to
create these, the user must first have a developer account, which can be created
here: http://developer.paypal.com

To create merchant and buyer's preconfigured test accounts, please read:
https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/ebook/PP_Sandbox_UserGuide/test_user_setup.html

Note:	Due to authorization issues, some of the tests require the merchant account to
        be of type "Website Payments Pro".


============================================
      Verifying the merchant's account
============================================

The merchant account should be verified to make mass payments. To do this, log in
at the sandbox (http://sandbox.paypal.com) and click on the "Get Verified" link
on the navigation menu.

Select "Link bank account". "Routing number" and "Account number" should be already
filled in. Set "HSBC" as your "Bank name".


============================================
          Fraud Management Setup
============================================

In order to test "managePendingTransactionStatus" method, the merchant must first
set up Fraud Management filters. To do so, log in at the sandbox and click
"Fraud Management" under the Tools pannel.

Then, activate the "Maximum Transaction Amount" filter and set the maximum
value to $1.


==================================
 Setting up the test environment
==================================

To setup the test, user must first set the following system properties:
	* paypal.api_username: merchant's username
	* paypal.api_password: merchant's password
	* paypal.api_signature: merchant's signature
    * paypal.buyer_email: buyer's email address
	* paypal.test_transaction_id: id of the test transaction created


Note:	Reauthorization is not tested in PaypalTestDriver, because a reauthorization
	can only be made after a 3-day "honor period" after the payment was made.
