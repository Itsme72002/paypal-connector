Integration testing with Paypal's API of the implemented methods can be found
in org.mule.module.paypal.integration.PaypalTestDriver.

==================================
 Setting up the test environment
==================================

This tests requires existing merchant and buyer's test accounts. Also, testing
for some of the API methods require an existing transaction.

To create a test merchant account, user must first have a developer account,
which can be created here: http://developer.paypal.com

To create merchant and buyer's preconfigured test accounts, please read:
https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/ebook/PP_Sandbox_UserGuide/test_user_setup.html

Note:	Due to authorization issues, some of the tests require the merchant account to
	be of type "Website Payments Pro".

Once logged in at http://sandbox.paypal.com as the buyer, a test transaction can be created here:
https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business={seller@domain.com}
(Note: 'seller@domain' is the merchant's email address, which is not exactly the same as his username)


To setup the test, user must first set the following system properties:
	* paypal.username: merchant's username
	* paypal.password: merchant's password
	* paypal.signature: merchant's signature
	* paypal.testTransactionId: id of the test transaction created

Note:	Reauthorization is not tested in PaypalTestDriver, because a reauthorization
	can only be made after a 3-day "honor period" after the payment was made.
